### Tips
#### Alias Commands: You can create shortcuts for long commands.

Now you can use git co instead of git checkout.
```
git config --global alias.co checkout
```

Global Ignore: Configure global ignore patterns for files you donâ€™t want to track.
```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Feel free to adapt this cheatsheet to suit your workflow and needs. Happy coding!
